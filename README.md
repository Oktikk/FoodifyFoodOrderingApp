# FoodifyFoodOrderingApp
**Foodify** is an app for ordering food from restaurants. I created it as part of a university project. I used WPF and the MVVM pattern to create it. The application allows you to create an account and log in, then place orders by selecting items from the menu and displaying previous orders.
